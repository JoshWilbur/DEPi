# System Monitor Project
Name: Joshua Wilbur

This project contains code to run a system monitor for a Linux-based computer. Due to time and course restrictions, the values are currently mocked. I intend to add code for real values soon as this will be used to monitor my cluster. 

# Operating Instructions
